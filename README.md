# code-recognition
It is a program to detect the validation code by nodejs. It utilizes two open source software, imagemagick and tesseract-ocr. The former is used to process the image, and the latter is applied to detect the code. The results are satisfying in my experiment.
It is only valid for simple code with little interruption. You can run the application by execute the command "node app" in the project path. The prerequite is the Node.js and the two opensource npm.
